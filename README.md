# MathForGames,Demo

Contains a demonstration program for a custom made math library. The player circle can be translated via the WASD keys, rotated via the Q and E keys, and scaled via the F and G keys. 

Download the .zip file at https://github.com/KevinHall2/MathForGames-Demo/releases and extract its contents to your preferred folder. Select the .exe file to run the program.
